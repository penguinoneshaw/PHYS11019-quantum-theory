# Revision Notes for PHYS11019: Quantum Theory at the University of Edinburgh
## Contents
Will, theoretically, cover
 - Feynman path integrals,
 - relativistic quantum mechanics,
 - _fun_ things like Dyson series and interactions,
 - the beginnings of Feynman diagrams.

## Build Requirements
Written in LaTeX2e, and designed pretty much to be compiled with ```pdflatex```.
Irritatingly, it *does not* compile on the CP Lab machines, since all of the requisite packages are missing, and it's not possible to download them manually, so you'll have to use a local copy on a different system.

## Stylistic Choices
General sarcastic tone is a thing which should be continued throughout.
The format of all source files is that a new sentence should be on its own line, since this allows Git to do its job.
Where possible, integrals are written with the 'dx' at the end, since from my perspective this is **so much nicer to read**, except where the integrand is clearly unwieldy or it makes sense to pair integral sign and measure off.

## Current Rendered Version
So far as I can be bothered, there's a current build of the document [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrrooeayy4ir5lc/quantum-theory-latest.pdf?dl=0).
