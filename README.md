# Revision Notes for PHYS11019: Quantum Theory at the University of Edinburgh
## Contents
Will, theoretically, cover 
 - Feynman path integrals, 
 - relativistic quantum mechanics, 
 - _fun_ things like Dyson series and interactions, 
 - the beginnings of Feynman diagrams.

## Build Requirements
Written in LaTeX2e, and designed pretty much to be compiled with ```pdflatex```. 

Pls help. General sarcastic tone is a thing which should be continued throughout.
